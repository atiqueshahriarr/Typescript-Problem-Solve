<h1>How TypeScript Improves Code Quality and Project Maintainability</h1>
<p>
    TypeScript, developed by Microsoft, is a superset of JavaScript that adds static data types to the language. These types help developers write safer, cleaner, and more maintainable code — whether they are working on small-scale or large-scale projects. By defining data types, developers can catch errors early during development, saving time and improving code reliability.
</p>
<p>Here are a few key reasons why TypeScript is a powerful tool for modern developers:</p>
    <h3>1. Find Errors Early and Easily</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, many bugs only appear at runtime. With TypeScript, most of these issues are caught during development, before the code even runs. This means less time spent debugging and more confidence that your code works as expected.</p>

    <h3>2. Improve Readability</h3>
    <p>Declaring variable types makes code easier to understand — both for you and for your teammates. Future developers can quickly grasp how the code works without needing extra comments or explanations about data types.</p>

    <h3>3. Supports Large-Scale Projects</h3>
    <p>For large projects, keeping track of all variables, functions, and modules in plain JavaScript can be challenging. Since TypeScript is statically typed, it offers a clear structure that makes it easier to track and manage complex codebases as they grow.</p>

    <h3>4. Easily Target Different JavaScript Versions</h3>
    <p>TypeScript can compile your code to any version of JavaScript (like ES5, ES6, etc.). This makes it simple to support older browsers or newer platforms — you can adjust the target JavaScript version with just one configuration setting.</p>
    <p>TypeScript adds a layer of safety, clarity, and scalability to your JavaScript projects. Whether you're building a small app or a large enterprise-level system, it helps you catch errors early, write readable code, manage complexity, and ensure compatibility across platforms.</p>
